# Setup

This react application was generated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It has all the standard setups.

Follow these steps if you are using zip/git mode (i.e. not available inside Devskiller in-browser IDE):

1. `npm install` – install dependencies
2. `npm test` – run all tests (this will be used to evaluate your solutions)
3. `npm start` – run the project locally

## Your Task
Your task is to finish the form so it have all following functionalities:

### 1. Form should work

- Finish the `ContactForm` component, so that it works (now it doesn't)
- Initial values should be rendered, even if empty
- User should be able to change values
- Every change should invoke `onChange` function with the changed widget's name and value
- User can submit form using button or pressing ENTER in fields (except `textarea`)
- Form submission should invoke `onSubmit` function with the current form data

### 2. User can log in, so name and email are filled-in

- When user presses log-in button, current user info should appear
- When user is logged in, user's name and email should be filled-in inside the form

### 3. After form is sent a _Thank You_ message should appear

- Finish the `Message` component
- It should not display any header (`.message-header`) by default, unless specified
- It can use text property or just display its children in `.message-body`

Now it's your turn to:

- Fix issues so that tests pass
- Solve all issues mentioned here
- Test your code on platform to see if all tests passed
